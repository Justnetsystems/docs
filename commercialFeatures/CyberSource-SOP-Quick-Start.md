> Note: Broadleaf Commerce currently offers integration with CyberSource using the Silent Order Post method through a commercial integration module. To obtain this third party integration or if you have any questions about this module, please contact us at info@broadleafcommerce.org

Broadleaf Commerces offers an out-of-the-box CyberSource solution that requires little configuration and is easily set up. 
The quick start solution implements the [[Silent Order Post | http://www.cybersource.com/developers/develop/integration_methods/silent_order_post/]] model offered by CyberSource API.
This implementation should be useful for those with a simple checkout flow. For a more customized solution, please see [[CyberSource SOP Advance Configuration]].
