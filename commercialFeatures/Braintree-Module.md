> Note: Broadleaf Commerce currently offers integration with Braintree through a commercial integration module. To obtain this third party integration or if you have any questions about this module, please contact us at info@broadleafcommerce.org

There are two ways to get started integrating this payment gateway into your eCommerce application.
Broadleaf offers a [[Braintree Quick Start]] solution that allows developers to easily add Braintree functionality
with little configuration. If you have a simple eCommerce store and want an easy way to start accepting payment, this is a good place to start.
On the other hand, if your application has a more complex payment workflow, you can customize your implementation using the [[Braintree Advance Configuration]] guide.
