[JRebel](http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/) is a Java Virtual Machine plugin that enables instant reloading of changes made to a Java class file as well as some property files and static files. We use it heavily in our develop of Broadleaf as it prevents the need for having to restart your server every time you make a change to a file.

> **The latest confirmed working version of JRebel and Broadleaf is 4.5.4**

> We've notoriously had problems with different versions of JRebel having problems with different aspects of Spring, GWT, and other frameworks in use in Broadleaf. Versions newer than the one mentioned above are known to have problems (specifically when loading the admin)

(Instructions coming soon)
