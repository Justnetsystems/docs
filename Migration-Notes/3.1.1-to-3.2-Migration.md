# 3.1.1 to 3.2 Migration

## Inventory Management
The quantity available field on `BLC_SKU` as well as the `CheckAvailabilityActivity` and `DecrementInventoryActivity` have been added to the framework out of the box. If you have performed any of the steps from [the 3.1.0 to 3.1.1 migration doc](http://docs.broadleafcommerce.org/core/3.1/migration-notes/3.1.0-to-3.1.1-migration) then you should undo them.

## Page Field Data
The relationship of Pages to their PageFields has been changed from a ManyToMany to a OneToMany, with the owning column on `blc_page_fld`. This means that `blc_page_fld_map` has gone away and will no longer be used. To update your data, you can **at your own risk** run the following query:

```sql
UPDATE blc_page_fld f SET page_id = (SELECT page_id FROM blc_page_fld_map m WHERE m.page_fld_id = f.page_fld_id)
```
