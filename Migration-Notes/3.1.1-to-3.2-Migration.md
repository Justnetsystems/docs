# 3.1.1 to 3.2 Migration

## Inventory Management
The quantity available field on `BLC_SKU` as well as the `CheckAvailabilityActivity` and `DecrementInventoryActivity` have been added to the framework out of the box. If you have performed any of the steps from [the 3.1.0 to 3.1.1 migration doc](http://docs.broadleafcommerce.org/core/3.1/migration-notes/3.1.0-to-3.1.1-migration) then you should undo them.
