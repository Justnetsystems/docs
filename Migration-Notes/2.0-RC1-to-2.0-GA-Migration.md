# 2.0 RC1 to 2.0 GA Migration

Although many things changed throughout milestone builds of 2.0, we wanted to call out one thing in particular.

As of the 2.0 GA release, the "owning" table for default sku : default product relationship has changed. Previously, the BLC\_PRODUCT table contained a DEFAULT\_SKU\_ID column. Now, this relationship is keyed by the DEFAULT\_PRODUCT\_ID column in the BLC\_SKU table.

You can run the following script **AT YOUR OWN RISK** to update your tables if you are moving from a version prior to GA to GA.

```sql
UPDATE BLC_SKU AS sku SET sku.DEFAULT_PRODUCT_ID = (SELECT PRODUCT_ID FROM BLC_PRODUCT WHERE DEFAULT_SKU_ID = sku.SKU_ID)
```

You'll also want to remove the DEFAULT_SKU_ID column from BLC_PRODUCT, as it is no longer used, and its continued presence can cause problems.
