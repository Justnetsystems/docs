# 3.0 to 3.1 Migration Notes

## Spring Social Integration

Per [Github Issue #444](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/444), the table name for UserConnection has been transformed to all-uppercase,
according to the Broadleaf table naming convention. This change will require running the following script  on your database:

```sql
SELECT * INTO BLC_USERCONNECTION FROM BLC_UserConnection;
DROP TABLE BLC_UserConnection;
```
