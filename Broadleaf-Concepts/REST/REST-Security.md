Broadleaf does not dictate how security should be applied to RESTful endpoints.  Broadleaf currently applies no security to services out of the box.  There are a number of mechanisms that can be used. In general, security can be applied in a number of ways.  We recommend using a protocol such as [[OAuth | http://www.oauth.net]].  You can also use [[Spring Security | http://static.springsource.org/spring-security/site/docs/3.1.x/reference/basic.html]] for authentication and authorization.
