# Deployment Models

There are a number of ways to deploy Solr.  We will cover three that are used most often:

1. Embedded Solr
2. Solr Cloud
3. Stand Alone Solr

For more information on all of these options, please see the [Solr Documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/About+This+Guide)

Broadleaf uses SolrJ, a Java library, to to communicate with each of these deployment types.
