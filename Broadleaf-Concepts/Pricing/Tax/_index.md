# Tax

Broadleaf Commerce can be configured for tax calculation in a number of ways. You can use the simple tax provider or  create your own custom tax module.

## Simple Tax Provider

The simple tax module is a good option for companies with simple tax needs.   It allows you to configure a tax rate that applies to an entire site or a tax rate for specific postal-codes, cities, states, or countries.

To find out more about the `SimpleTaxModule`, see the [[Simple Tax Module Configuration |Simple Tax Module]] section.

## Creating Your Own Tax Provider

If the provided modules in Broadleaf do not meet your needs, you can easily write a customized tax module to integrate with your tax calculator. Please view the [[Creating a Tax Module]] section.
