# Admin Exporters

Admin exporters give you the ability to provide manual integration with various systems.  For instance, you might want to import all of your Broadleaf orders into Quickbooks for accounting management.  You can write a custom exporter that will create a valid Quickbooks file based on Order date ranges that you can download and import into Quickbooks.  For the Catalog, you could write an exporter that took the Broadleaf catalog domain and write that to a file that is compatible with a catalog that might be responsible for handling fulfillment.

More information on creating custom exporters coming soon.
