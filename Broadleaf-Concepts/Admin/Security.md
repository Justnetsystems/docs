# Admin Security

The admin application has two Exploit Protection services in place. XSRF Protection, which is set to `true` by default, and XSS Protection, which is set to `false`. 

## Managing Exploit Protection

The bean `blExploitProtectionService` can be set in `WEB-INF/applicationContext-admin.xml`. The bean has two properties which will define if the given types of exploit protection are enabled.
 
 ```xml
 <bean id="blExploitProtectionService" class="org.broadleafcommerce.common.security.service.ExploitProtectionServiceImpl">
     <property name="xsrfProtectionEnabled" value="true" />
     <property name="xssProtectionEnabled" value="false" />
 </bean>
 ```

To turn ON **XSRF** (Cross-site Request Forgery) protection:
- Set the `xsrfProtectionEnabled` to `true`

To turn ON **XSS** (Cross-site scripting) protection:
- Set the `xssProtectionEnabled` to `true`
- To find more information on the XSS protection used in the admin visit the [AntiSamy Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_AntiSamy_Project)
