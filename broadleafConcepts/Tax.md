Broadleaf Commerce can be configured for tax calculation in a number of ways. You can use the simple tax calculator, one of our included third party shipping modules (such as CyberSource), or by using a custom shipping module.

## Simple Tax Module

## CyberSource Tax Module

As an alternative to simple tax, Broadleaf Commerce offers the CyberSource Tax calculation module. Please refer to the [[CyberSource Tax Configuration | CyberSource Tax Module]] section for more information.

## Creating Your Own Tax Module

If the provided modules in Broadleaf do not meet your needs, you can easily write a customized tax module to integrate with your tax calculator. Please view the [[Creating a Tax Module]] section.
