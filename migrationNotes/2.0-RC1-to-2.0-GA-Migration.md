Although many things changed throughout milestone builds of 2.0, we wanted to call out one thing in particular.

As of the 2.0 GA release, the "owning" table for default sku : default product relationship has changed. Previously, the BLC\_PRODUCT table contained a DEFAULT\_SKU\_ID column. Now, this relationship is keyed by the DEFAULT\_PRODUCT\_ID column in the BLC\_SKU table.

You can run the following script **AT YOUR OWN RISK** to update your tables if you are moving from a version prior to GA to GA.

```sql
UPDATE BLC_SKU AS sku SET sku.DEFAULT_PRODUCT_ID = (SELECT PRODUCT_ID FROM BLC_PRODUCT WHERE DEFAULT_SKU_ID = sku.SKU_ID)
```
