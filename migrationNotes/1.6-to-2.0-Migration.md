The transition from 1.6 to 2.0 consists of several different migration steps. We have added a lot of features and refactored key components in Broadleaf to support future development, and unfortunately, that means migrating to 2.0 requires some effort. Where possible, we have maintained legacy support to ease the transitional period.

## OrderService / CartService

Cart operations such as add, update and remove have been moved out of the order service and into Broadleaf workflows. Your options are to either refactor your code to utilize the power of workflows or utlize the legacy order services.

## Security

One key difference between Broadleaf versions 1.6 and 2.0 is the upgrade from Spring 3.0 to Spring 3.1.  This includes Spring Security.  The changes to the Spring Security configuration are fairly minimal for most applications.
