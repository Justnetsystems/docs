The transition from 1.6 to 2.0 consists of several different migration steps. We have added a lot of features and refactored key components in Broadleaf to support future development, and unfortunately, that means migrating to 2.0 requires some effort. Where possible, we have maintained legacy support to ease the transitional period.

## OrderService / CartService

Pre-2.0, the add to cart / remove from cart / update cart logic was embedded in the OrderService. As we were involved in various implementations, we learned that many users want to customize these operations to add their own domain specific logic. As a result of this, we have developed workflow-based cart operations, which allow you to hook in your custom activities and error handlers. You can learn more about these new workflows on the [[Cart Operations]] page.

However, we realize that this is a substantial change that not all users want to make. Therefore, we've kept the old services and renamed them to `LegacyOrderService` and `LegacyCartService`. Migration steps to use these classes are as follows:

- Any classes that extend `OrderService` or `CartService` must be updated to extend the legacy versions

- You must tell Broadleaf that you want to use the legacy services by overriding the `blOrderService` bean. This is done in the same way normal [[service extension | Extending Services]] happens, by placing the following line in your `applicationContext.xml` file:
```xml
<bean id="blOrderService" class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.legacy.LegacyCartServiceImpl" />
```
> Note: If you are extending `LegacyCartServiceImpl`, you should instead use the fully qualified name of your class.

That's it!
