## Workflows
Full, updated documentation on workflows is located at [[Workflows and Activities]]. This has actually made your custom configuration much simpler, as you no longer need to redeclare the entire Broadleaf workflow just to add a single activity. Instead, simply change the ordering of your activity.

For instance, you might have overridden the `blAddItemWorkflow` to execute some sort of analytics. You might find something like this in your applicationContext:

```xml
<bean id="blAddItemWorkflow" class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.workflow.SequenceProcessor">
    <property name="processContextFactory">
        <bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.workflow.CartOperationProcessContextFactory"/>
    </property>
    <property name="activities">
        <list>
            <bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.workflow.add.ValidateAddRequestActivity"/>
            
            <!-- Custom activity for analytics -->
            <bean class="com.mycompany.core.workflow.AddToAnalyticsActivity"/>
            
            <bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.workflow.add.AddOrderItemActivity"/>
            <bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.workflow.add.AddFulfillmentGroupItemActivity"/>
            <bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.workflow.PriceOrderIfNecessaryActivity"/>
            <bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.order.service.workflow.VerifyFulfillmentGroupItemsActivity"/>
        </list>
    </property>
    <property name="defaultErrorHandler" ref="blDefaultErrorHandler"/>
</bean>
```

Since these lists are now merged, if you were to start up the application you would get duplicates of the framework activities, all ordered at the end of the workflow. In the new way to configure workflows, the above definition would simplify to:

```xml
<bean id="blAddItemWorkflow" class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.workflow.SequenceProcessor">
   <property name="activities">
        <list>           
            <!-- Custom activity for analytics -->
            <!-- Explicitly specify the ordering to occur between the first and second activity -->
            <bean p:order="1500" class="com.mycompany.core.workflow.AddToAnalyticsActivity"/>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>
```

> ****Important Note:**** don't forget to specify orderings for your activities if they need to occur in-between framework activities. If you do not explicitly specify an order, your activity will be placed at the end of the workflow (more explicitly, the default order is `Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE`).
