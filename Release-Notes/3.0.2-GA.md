# Broadleaf 3.0.2-GA Release

_Released on September 9, 2013_

This is the second patch release in the Broadleaf 3.0 line. This release includes quite a few enhancements and features that we were unable to include in 3.0.0-GA and 3.0.1-GA. We recommend updating to this patch release immediately as this is a drop-in patch release to the 3.0 line.
