# Broadleaf 3.1.8-GA

This is the 8th release in the 3.1 line of Broadleaf and we recommend updating to this release immediately. Some of the notable changes in this release:

- Functional testing with Geb and Spock - check out the new [broadleaf-admin-functional-tests module on GitHub](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/tree/aa506877356af61f59c0301c34e68809d885e559/admin/broadleaf-admin-functional-tests/src/main/groovy). We have started doing some functional test prototyping in the admin with Geb and see it as a big improvement over Selenium. Stay tuned as we continue to improve these Geb page objects and talk about how we are using them!
- Adding a transient key-value map to Customer to hold session-based state
- Ensure that sessions are not created when the system is configured to not use them
- Fix an issue from 3.1.2-GA which caused product attributes to always fail validation in the admin
- Allow for the configuration of Customer-based offers to be automatically considered in the system

This release contains all fixes in the 3.0 line up to and including [[3.0.13 GA]].
