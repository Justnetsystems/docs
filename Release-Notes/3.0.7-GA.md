## !!WARNING!!: This release contains 2 critical issues: [619](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/619) and [620](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/620). We recommend skipping this release and instead going straight to [[3.0.8-GA | 3.0.8 GA]].

# Broadleaf 3.0.7-GA Release

Broadleaf 3.0.7-GA is now available on Maven central. As this is a patch release to the 3.0 line, we recommend upgrading immediately, no migration necessary. Read on for additional release information.

This is the 7th patch release in the Broadleaf 3.0 line. Quite a few major bugs were resolved in this release, mainly related to various problems in the admin. A few were specifically related to modifying and creating existing admin users. One of the most notable resolved issues is a bug that has existed in Broadleaf for years where an error message was logged on startup ([#58](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/58)). While it did not actually cause a real issue (like broken functionality) it was a red herring for other underlying problems. We also sped up the build time of the framework by over 1 minute by updating the maven source plugin that we were using (see [#583](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/583)).
