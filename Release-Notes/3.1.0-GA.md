# Broadleaf 3.1.0-GA

3.1.0-GA includes a ton of awesome features, bug fixes and enhancements. Here are the major feature highlights of this release.

### Friendly REST exceptions
There is a new class to help build XML/JSON responses into exceptions that might occur in your REST APIs with `BroadleafWebServicesException`s. Usage of this class hs through a static invocation to `build()`. An example is in the `addOfferCode` method of `CartEndpoint`:

```java
public OrderWrapper addOfferCode(HttpServletRequest request,
        String promoCode,
        boolean priceOrder) {
    // code removed

    OfferCode offerCode = offerService.lookupOfferCodeByCode(promoCode);

    if (offerCode == null) {
        throw BroadleafWebServicesException.build(Response.Status.NOT_FOUND.getStatusCode())
                .addMessage(BroadleafWebServicesException.PROMO_CODE_INVALID, promoCode);
    }
    
    // etc...
    
}
```

The exception builder takes in the HTTP status code (in this case a 404) and then also adds a not-found message. This exception is later parsed by the `BroadleafRestExceptionMapper`. This exception mapper should already be hooked up but if not, include it as a bean in your `applicationContext-rest-api.xml`:

```xml
    <bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.core.web.api.BroadleafRestExceptionMapper" scope="singleton"/>
```

> Note: error messages are translated via Spring's message i18n property resolution. The above case also uses a parameterized message with the promo code that was not found

### Site Maps

There is new functionality to configure a site map generator to scan through your existing Category, Product and Page domain and output a sitemap file for web crawlers. Documentation on how to set this up are in [[SEO]]. One additional configuration step is to add a new controller to respond to requests for a site map:

```java
@Controller
public class SiteMapController extends BroadleafSiteMapController {
    @RequestMapping(value = { "/sitemap*.xml", "sitemap*.gz" })
    @ResponseBody
    public FileSystemResource retrieveSiteMapIndex(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws IOException {
        return super.retrieveSiteMapFile(request, response);
    }
}
```

You also want to notify crawlers via `robots.txt` about your site map. You can add this functionality with a robots controller:

```java
@Controller
public class RobotsController extends BroadleafRobotsController {
    @RequestMapping(value = { "/robots.txt" })
    @ResponseBody
    public String getRobotsFile(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) {
        return super.getRobotsFile(request, response);
    }
}
```

### Payment Domain Refactor
See the [[Payment]] section for more information on what this looks like and [[3.0 to 3.1 Migration]] if you are upgrading from 3.0

### Cart and Customer Cleanup Jobs
You can now configure a Quartz job to remove old IN_PROCESS Carts and non-registered users from your system. Below is an example configuration that will delete all `IN_PROCESS` Orders (carts) that are older than 30 days (2592000 seconds):

```xml
 <bean id="purgeCartConfig" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MapFactoryBean">
    <property name="sourceMap">
        <map>
            <entry key="SECONDS_OLD" value="2592000"/>
            <entry key="STATUS" value="IN_PROCESS"/>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean id="purgeCartJobDetail" class="org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean">
    <property name="targetObject" ref="blResourcePurgeService" />
    <property name="targetMethod" value="purgeCarts" />
    <property name="arguments">
        <list>
            <ref bean="purgeCartConfig"/>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean id="purgeCartTrigger" class="org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.SimpleTriggerFactoryBean">
    <property name="jobDetail" ref="purgeCartJobDetail" />
    <property name="startDelay" value="30000" />
    <property name="repeatInterval" value="86400000" />
</bean>
```

Valid parameters in the `purgeCartConfig` map are:

- **SECONDS_OLD** - number of seconds since the last update date of the cart
- **STATUS** - comma-delimited status from `OrderStatus`. For instance, if you wanted to clean up all `IN_PROCESS` (carts) and `NAMED` (wishlists) orders:

   ```xml
   <entry key="STATUS" value="IN_PROCESS,NAMED" />
   ```

- **NAME** - the name of `NAMED` Orders to delete. This is useful if your implementation uses specific names of wishlist or saved carts and they are not normally user-specified   
- **IS_PREVIEW** - "true" or "false" for the value of the `IS_PREVIEW` column on Order. This is mainly used in enterprise.

Anonymous Customers can also be cleaned up. While Broadleaf does not persist a new Customer on every single visit, new Customers are persisted when a user adds something to their cart. This is an example of a quarts job that cleans up all non-registered Customers that have not been updated in the last 30 days:

```xml
<bean id="purgeCustomerConfig" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MapFactoryBean">
    <property name="sourceMap">
        <map>
            <entry key="SECONDS_OLD" value="2592000"/>
            <entry key="IS_REGISTERED" value="false"/>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean id="purgeCustomerJobDetail" class="org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean">
    <property name="targetObject" ref="blResourcePurgeService" />
    <property name="targetMethod" value="purgeCustomers" />
    <property name="arguments">
        <list>
            <ref bean="purgeCustomerConfig"/>
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean id="purgeCustomerTrigger" class="org.springframework.scheduling.quartz.SimpleTriggerFactoryBean">
    <property name="jobDetail" ref="purgeCustomerJobDetail" />
    <property name="startDelay" value="30000" />
    <property name="repeatInterval" value="86400000" />
</bean>
```

Valid parameters in the `purgeCustomerConfig` map are:

- **SECONDS_OLD** - number of seconds since the last update date of the Customer
- **IS_REGISTERED** - "true" or "false" for the value of the registered field on Customer
- **IS_DEACTIVATED** - true" or "false" for the value of the deactivated field on Customer   
- **IS_PREVIEW** - "true" or "false" for the value of the `IS_PREVIEW` column on Customer. This is used in enterprise.

### Database-managed System Properties

Rather than managing system properties only via [[Runtime Environment Configuration]], you can now manage properties in the database via the `BLC_SYSTEM_PROPERTY` table. If the property is not found in the database, then the fallback is to look for the property in property files configured according to [[Runtime Environment Configuration]].

If you would like to take advantage of this functionality then you can remove an `@Value` annotation on a bean property and override the getter to invoke `BLCSystemProperty` like so:

```java
protected boolean getSomeBeanProperty() {
    BLCSystemProperty.resolveBooleanSystemProperty("some.bean.property");
}
```

This is how we refactored the `TranslationRequestProcessor` to determine if translations should be enabled:

```java
@Component("blTranslationRequestProcessor")
public class TranslationRequestProcessor extends AbstractBroadleafWebRequestProcessor {
	// ...

    protected boolean getTranslationEnabled() {
        return BLCSystemProperty.resolveBooleanSystemProperty("i18n.translation.enabled");
    }

	// ...
}
```

### Thymeleaf 2.1

We have continued and enhanced our usage of Thymeleaf by updating to the latest GA version. To see what comes with Thymeleaf 2.1, see their [What's new in Thymeleaf 2.1 page](http://www.thymeleaf.org/whatsnew21.html).

### Friendly Permissions

We refactored admin permissions to make them more intuitive for adding to users and roles.  The idea here is that if you want to give permissions to a user or role for a certain section of the admin, all you need to do is add either of the friendly permissions for that section ("View [section]" or "Maintain [section]").  We added a boolean value on `Permission` called `isFriendly` which indicates that this is a permission that contains child permissions maintained through `BLC_ADMIN_PERMISSION_XREF`.
