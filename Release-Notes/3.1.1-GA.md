## Fancybox Removal
!!IMPORTANT!!

If you are on 3.1.0-GA workspace version of the Heat Clinic, **you may be in violation of the Fancybox license**. Fancybox is free to use for non-commercial websites, but there is a fee if you are using it on a commercial website. [Click here for the Fancybox license information](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/#license). You can purchase a license for commercial use from [the Fancybox website](http://sites.fastspring.com/fancyapps/product/store).

In our demo site, we have removed Fancybox to instead use [Simple Modal](http://www.ericmmartin.com/projects/simplemodal/). Simple Modal is released under the MIT license which means you can use it however you like. If you would like to see exactly what we did to remove the Fancybox dependency, check out the [diff from DemoSite](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/commit/4c4ec85301e0f8d770c89396ee97b3f1c3a3b7d0)

This release does not *require* any migration, but if you would like to enable the new framework inventory features you will need to follow the changes referenced in [[3.1.0 to 3.1.1 Migration]]. We recommend updating to this release immediately.
