Broadleaf 3.0.6-GA is now available on Maven central. As this is a patch release to the 3.0 line, we recommend upgrading immediately, no migration necessary. Read on for additional release information.

This is the 6th patch release in the Broadleaf 3.0 line, and represents resolution of some bugs that have existed in the system for a while. The most notable of these was [issue 195](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/195) which did not respect the 'max uses' field for offer codes. The full fix for this in the 3.0 line because there needed to be a database table modification to obtain it. However, we have a steadfast rule that all patch releases should be 'drop-in'. This means that no database modifications and no API method removals are allowed between patch releases. However, if you add this XML configuration to an application context:

```xml
<bean id="blOfferAuditFixClassTransformer" class="org.broadleafcommerce.common.extensibility.jpa.copy.DirectCopyClassTransformer">
    <constructor-arg name="moduleName" value="Offer Audit Fix" />
    <property name="xformTemplates">
        <map>
            <entry>
                <key><value>org.broadleafcommerce.core.offer.domain.OfferAuditImpl</value></key>
                <value>org.broadleafcommerce.core.offer.domain.OfferAuditWeaveImpl</value>
            </entry>
        </map>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean id="customClassTransformers" class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.ListFactoryBean">
    <property name="sourceList">
        <list>
            <ref bean="blOfferAuditFixClassTransformer" />
        </list>
    </property>
</bean>

<bean class="org.broadleafcommerce.common.extensibility.context.merge.LateStageMergeBeanPostProcessor">
    <property name="collectionRef" value="customClassTransformers" />
    <property name="targetRef" value="blMergedClassTransformers" />
</bean>
```

And add this column to the `BLC_OFFER_AUDIT` table in your production database:

```sql
ALTER TABLE BLC_OFFER_AUDIT ADD `OFFER_CODE_ID` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL;
```

And then hook up the Spring Instrument jar ([download link](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/DemoSite/blob/master/lib/spring-instrument-3.2.2.RELEASE.jar?raw=true) as a `-javaagent` flag:

```bash
export CATALINA_OPTS="$CATALINA_OPTS -javaagent=/full/path/to/spring-instrument-3.2.2.RELEASE.jar "
```

Then your Broadleaf site will properly respect the 'max uses' flag for offer codes.

> Note: while this is **strongly recommended** if you do not add the above configuration and you do not need that bug fix, then your Broadleaf site will still function as expected. That configuration will no longer be required in Broadleaf 3.1+.
