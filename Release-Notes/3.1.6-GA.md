# Broadleaf 3.1.6-GA

## IMPORTANT NOTE!!

## This release contains a critical bug and we recommend skipping this release altogether and going straight to 3.1.7-GA

There was a critical bug in the 3.1.5-GA release regarding rollback handlers and failed payment transactions. This release was designed to fix that critical bug as well a newly-discovered critical bug where multiple requests could make modifications to an order at the same time. The solution involved locking modifications to an Order on the current session. This is subsequent followed up in 3.2.0-GA with a [database version of this locking mechanism](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/1044).

Because of the critical nature of the bugs that were resolved, we recommend upgrading to this release immediately.
