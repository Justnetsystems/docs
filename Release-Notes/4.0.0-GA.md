# Broadleaf 4.0.0-GA Release

###Thymeleaf Layout Dialect
We now support the Thymleaf Lay Dialect. With this enhancement, pages can be designed from a heirarchical approach without needing external libraries. Now you are able to utilize Thymeleaf Layouts which allow you to style the content and pass entire fragments to included pages, increasing reusability and code comprehension of your UI.

To enable the use of the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect, add the following to your runtime properties files. <br /> ```thymeleaf.useLayoutDialect=true```

For further information about the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect, please refer to the Thymeleaf Layout Dialect section [here](http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/layouts.html#thymeleaf-layout-dialect).
> We do not recommend using the Out of Box Broadleaf LayoutMap configuration anymore.
