# Broadleaf 3.1.3-GA

This release is the 3rd patch release of the 3.1 line. If you are on the 3.1 line already, we strongly recommend upgrading to this new patch release.

## Required migration steps
We strive to make our Broadleaf patch releases (like 3.1.2-GA to 3.1.3-GA) as smooth as possible and try to not make any requirements on migrations for sites that are currently using Broadleaf. However, in 3.1.3-GA there is a required migration step that you need to perform in your admin configuration. **Please see the [[3.1.2 to 3.1.3 Migration]] notes for required modifications that you will need to make in your site**

Since this release is a cumulative release, this includes all features and bug fixes in the [[3.0.11-GA | 3.0.11 GA release]]. This includes:

- Java 8 JVM compatibility
- Universal Google Analytics support
- Update to Spring 3.2.9.RELEASE
- Static asset url transformation support
- Better support for standalone Solr servers

Notable features specifically in 3.1.3-GA:

- Update to the latest Thymeleaf 2.1 patch release (2.1.2.RELEASE)
- Better support for PCI SAQ level "C" and "D" implementations
