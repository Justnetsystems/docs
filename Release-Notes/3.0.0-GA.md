# Broadleaf 3.0.0-GA Release

See the blog post about this release: http://www.broadleafcommerce.com/blog/broadleaf-commerce-version-3-0

This release represents one of the largest releases in Broadleaf's history. The main goal of this release was to completely remove ALL dependencies on GWT in the admin. The admin panel has been completely rewritten in Spring MVC and Thymeleaf to allow for easier customizability and to get away from the large amount of technical debt we were rapidly accruing.

Upgrading to this release requires a fair amount of migration from both a core API standpoint as well as the database. We have extensive migration notes for all 2.x versions of Broadleaf located at http://docs.broadleafcommerce.org/core/current/migration-notes. More migration may be required depending on how much you have customized your Broadleaf site, and also depending on how much you have customized the GWT admin.

An at-a-glance view of the issues that were closed in this release:
> Note: These issues are only about half of the issues that were resolved in 3.0.0-GA, as we switched to utilizing GitHub Issues for our issue tracking about halfway through development of this release.
