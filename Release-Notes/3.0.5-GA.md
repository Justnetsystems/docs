# Broadleaf 3.0.5-GA Release

This release is a patch release designed to immediately fix [issue 529](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/529) as 3.0.4-GA had no working rule builders. Rather than updating to this release, we recommend skipping this and going straight to [3.0.6-GA](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/releases/tag/broadleaf-3.0.6-GA) which contains all of these issue resolutions and then some.
