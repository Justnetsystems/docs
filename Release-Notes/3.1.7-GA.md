# Broadleaf 3.1.7-GA

This release is designed to fix a single critical issue present only in 3.1.6-GA in regards to rolling back failed payments. In that release, failed payments would not get rolled back at all. We recommend skipping that release altogether and going straight to 3.1.7-GA or above.
