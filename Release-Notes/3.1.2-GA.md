# Broadleaf 3.1.2-GA

This release is the 2nd patch release of the 3.1 line. If you are on the 3.1 line already, we strongly recommend upgrading to this new patch release, especially if you [are using Windows for development](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce/issues/838) to take advantage of some file path fixes. This release also includes some fixes for Oracle databases in the admin.

We have also introduced a couple of new features in the admin like a [[row level security API | Admin Row Level Security]] and the ability to have lookup fields in structured content and pages.
