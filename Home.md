## Introduction

BroadleafCommerce is an open-source, e-commerce framework written entirely in Java.

It is targeted at facilitating the development of enterprise-class, commerce-driven sites by providing a robust data model, services, rich administration platform, and specialized tooling that take care of most of the "heavy lifting" work.

To accomplish this goal, we have developed the platform based on the key feature sets required by world-class online retailers - and we're committed to continually expanding our feature offering. We've also taken extra steps to guarantee interoperability with today's enterprise by utilizing standards wherever possible and incorporating best-of-breed, open-source software libraries from the community.
