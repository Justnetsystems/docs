## Introduction

BroadleafCommerce is an open-source, eCommerce framework written entirely in Java.

It is targeted at facilitating the development of enterprise-class, commerce-driven sites by providing a robust data and service model, a rich administration platform, and specialized tooling that takes care of core commerce functionality.

To accomplish this goal, we have developed the platform based on the key feature sets required by world-class online retailers and we're committed to continually expanding our feature offering. We've also taken extra steps to guarantee interoperability with today's enterprise by utilizing standards wherever possible and incorporating best-of-breed, open-source software libraries from the community.

## **Important Note**
This documentation is for the Broadleaf 2.2.0-GA version. We have made extensive changes to Broadleaf 3.0, due for GA sometime in late June 2013. The most notable of these extensive changes includes completely overhauling our admin application to get off of GWT and move exclusively to Spring MVC. For this reason, we recommend new applications to reference the Broadleaf **3.0.0-BETA2** version for the time being (which is a relatively stable build). The documentation for Broadleaf 3.0 is located [here](http://docs.broadleafcommerce.org/dev)
