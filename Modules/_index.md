# Modules

Starting with Broadleaf 2.2.0, non-fundamental features are being developed in modules that users can choose to utilize if it makes sense for their implementation. Many of these modules are provided under the same license as the core framework while some are released under the enterprise license. Please visit the [Broadleaf website](http://www.broadleafcommerce.com) to learn more about the differences between the community and enterprise versions.
