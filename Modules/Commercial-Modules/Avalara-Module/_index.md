## How it works

Avalara provides two different ways of accessing their tax calculation tools: SOAP and REST APIs.
Currently SOAP(Legacy) is their most extensively supported form of tax calculation. While REST is less extensive, it still provides much of what SOAP will.

Refer to this [table](http://developer.avalara.com/api-docs/soap/soap-or-rest) to get a more in-depth look at this gap.

- Not listed :
 
    * SOAP provides use of multiple currencies for any particular company, REST allows for use of one
