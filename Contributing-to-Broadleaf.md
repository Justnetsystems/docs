# Contributing to Broadleaf

Want to contribute to Broadleaf? Awesome! 

> Note: This section describes how to contribute code back to Broadleaf Commerce. Modifying Broadleaf Commerce code is not generally part of implementing a Broadleaf Commerce site - instead, you build on top of Broadleaf, extending where necessary. Please check out the [[Getting Started]] page for more info.

## <a name="wiki-obtaining-source"></a>Obtaining the Source Code

You can simply clone the [BroadleafCommerce repository on GitHub](https://github.com/BroadleafCommerce/BroadleafCommerce) to obtain the source code. You will likely want to test out what you're developing against an application. We recommend doing so against the DemoSite application. The easiest way to iteratively develop will be to run a local Maven install on the Broadleaf source you downloaded with the `blc-development` profile. This will add in JRebel targets into the Broadleaf JARs and let you reload classes on the fly.

## <a name="wiki-submitting-bugs"></a>Submitting Bugs and Patches

We encourage the community to assist with the development of Broadleaf Commerce and you can [find us on GitHub here](http://www.github.com/BroadleafCommerce). We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, and new features! You can always find the latest GA release in the `master` branch. Nightly snapshots are released from the `develop` branch.

Developers that create custom demos to showcase parts of Broadleaf can contact us at info@broadleafcommerce.org - we'd love to feature your demo!

## <a name="wiki-official-contributor"></a>Becoming an Official Contributor

Broadleaf Commerce will occasionally accept new project members. New project members will generally be extended an invitation from Broadleaf Commerce after having submitted patches in the past via our patch submittal process outlined above. If you are interested in becoming a full member of the project, you may also contact info@broadleafcommerce.org and express your interest.
