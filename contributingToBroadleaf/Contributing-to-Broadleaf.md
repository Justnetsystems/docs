## <a name="wiki-obtaining-source" />Obtaining the Source Code

For most implementations, obtaining the source code and binaries through Maven is the recommended approach. If you used our Eclipse quick start project, you will already have the source code in your workspace. If not, check out the [[Environemnt Setup]] page to learn how to import it.

## <a name="wiki-submitting-bugs" />Submitting Bugs and Patches

We encourage the community to assist with the development of Broadleaf Commerce and you can [find us on GitHub here](http://www.github.com/BroadleafCommerce). We welcome pull requests for bug fixes, enhancements, and new features! You can always find the latest GA release in the `master` branch. Nightly snapshots are released from the `develop` branch.

Developers that create custom demos to showcase parts of Broadleaf can contact us at info@broadleafcommerce.org - we'd love to feature your demo!
